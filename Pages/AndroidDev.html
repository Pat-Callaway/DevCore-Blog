        <p>Android Development is something that I thought I would never pursue. I have always been an avid Iphone user. There were times in my life where I would try an Android device and instantly regret my choice. People either made fun of me for the "green bubbles"(Yes, those people stil exist). I also did not think that the processor or device was fast enough. At that time I did not know much about the difference between Android and Iphone. All I knew was that Iphone was "in" and I desprately wanted to be "in".</p>
